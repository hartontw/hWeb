# hWeb

This is my personal website.

The goal of this webpage is show my resumee, projects and contact info.

The website has a showcase of web apps, parsers, webhooks, bots and other online aplications.

The website has a small login system to start. stop and restart the aplications.

The website is deployed on Raspbian Lite in a Raspberry Pi 3.

The startup.sh script depends of [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io).
